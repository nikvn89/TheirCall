// Confirms on the real StudioNet RPC that each calldata shape is DECODED by the
// node (no "RLP string ends with N superfluous bytes"). A row counts as decoded
// when the contract's sentence comes back or the node reports "execution failed";
// a network error or no answer fails the job. Uses gen_call write
// simulation, no wallet, no transaction. Every row is built to stop at a
// deterministic revert AFTER decoding, so no model call is made:
//   open_option is sent FROM the receiver wallet -> "The receiver cannot be the author"
//   elect / object_to_election / withdraw_option use an unknown id -> "Unknown option id"
//
